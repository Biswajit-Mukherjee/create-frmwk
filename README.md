## Documentation

To get started all you need is a working directory with Node installed. After running the npx command, it will automatically generate a package.json file and add all the required dependencies for you. Once finished the server will automatically start at localhost:3000 by default.

- To stop the server

    CTRL + C (CMD + C for Mac/Linux).

- To restart the server

```bash
    npm start
```

This will open the page on a new tab in the browser. The port number can be changed to any port of your choice.
